My name is Minhazul Abaydin, working as a data analyst for a couple of years now, with a certificate from Google: "Google Data Analytics." Besides my prolonged training in SQL, Python, and R, I have completed my B.Sc, and M.Sc. in Economics. I firmly believe that Data will bring the next revolution, and if we use it for a good cause, we can reshape the future perfectly.
